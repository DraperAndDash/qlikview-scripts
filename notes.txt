go through rob wunderlich QVC
change calendar script to be created by function like camden
include common calendar as standard
move calendar scripts to git hub
let app include calendar script from git hub

check if gitbash required for making commits if move to prj/github

things to go as qvs:
- calendar (multiple plus common) DONE!
- convert table to html DONE!
- resources (images and icons)
- colour variables
- getTimeDifference(startDateTime, endDateTime, interval s/h/m/D/M/Y, format, fieldName)
- max month variables etc generated for each calendar date - add this to generate calendar function?
- postcode/location data

common calendar
- need to supply primary key of the data table
- can loop through calendar table to get calendar fields
- what to do if more than one table? 

for images and icons check if on DraperAndDash domain before setting the resource path - DONE! not done :(
 - this doesn't work as still on domain if using D&D laptop but not on site. Need to check internet connection
resources folder is pretty slow downloading from our server. Try downloading from github?
